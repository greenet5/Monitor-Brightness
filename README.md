# Monitor-Brightness
Created this script in order to change the brightness of my external monitors without using the physical buttons.

This application uses the Screen Brightness Control module. It is currently a command-line application but may implement a gui eventually.

The program works as follows:
1) Gathers a list of all connected monitors
2) Prints the current brightness of all connected monitors
3) Asks the user for the desired brightness of monitor 1
4) adjusts monitor 1 brightness and prints the new brightness level
5) Asks the user for the desired brightness of monitor 2
6) adjusts monitor 2 brightness and prints the new brightness level
7) etc.

This application has only been tested on my machine so there may be bugs on other machines.
